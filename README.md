# "I am alone." 
### Global Game Jam 2016

Working off the theme of ritual, we wanted to get to the heart of what ritual is all about: remaking the world and establishing our place inside of it. "I am alone." is a game that gives the player the ability to create their own world through the power of narrative. The player is placed into a world with no context and must make choices that flesh out their past, present, and future.
